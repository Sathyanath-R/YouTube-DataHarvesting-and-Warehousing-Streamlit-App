**Project Title:** YouTube Data Extraction and Storage with SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit

**Introduction:** YouTube has emerged as a pivotal platform for creators and marketers, offering valuable insights into audience behavior and content performance. This project aims to develop an integrated solution using Python, MySQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit for efficiently gathering data from multiple YouTube channels, organizing it in a data repository, transferring it to a SQL database, and presenting interactive analysis through a Streamlit application.

**Skills Gained from the Project:**
Proficiency in Python scripting for data manipulation and application development.
Utilization of MongoDB for storing diverse data formats in a data repository.
Creation of interactive web applications with Streamlit for user-friendly data visualization.
Integration of APIs, particularly the YouTube API, for retrieving data from online platforms.
Data management techniques including storage, retrieval, and manipulation using MongoDB and MySQL databases.
Querying SQL databases for advanced data analysis and reporting.

**Domain:** Social Media Analytics

**Problem Statement:** The objective is to build a Streamlit application enabling users to explore and analyze data from multiple YouTube channels. 

**Key functionalities include:**
Retrieval of relevant data such as channel statistics, video metrics, and audience engagement metrics using the YouTube API.
Storage of collected data in MongoDB as an unstructured data repository.
Collection of data from up to 10 distinct YouTube channels and storage in the data repository.
Migration of data from the data repository to a SQL database for structured analysis.
Implementation of search and retrieval capabilities from the SQL database, including data merging for comprehensive channel insights.

**Approach:**

**Development of a Streamlit application:** Design a user-friendly interface for input and data visualization using Streamlit.

**Integration with the YouTube API:** Utilize the Google API client library to fetch channel and video data.

**Establishment of a MongoDB data repository:** Store collected data in MongoDB, suitable for handling diverse data types.

**Migration of data to a SQL database:** Transfer data from MongoDB to a SQL database (MySQL) for structured storage and analysis.

**Querying the SQL database:** Utilize SQL queries, potentially with libraries, to retrieve and process data.

**Presentation of data in the Streamlit application:** Showcase retrieved data through interactive visualizations and insights using Streamlit's capabilities.
